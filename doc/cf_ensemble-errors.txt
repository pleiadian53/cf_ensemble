# Tips 
  1. include label in seq2seq model has benefits
      + if not, the seq2seq model's accuracy is not good 
           PREDICTION ACCURACY (%):
           Train: 88.619, Test: 50.224
         + also the gap between Ein and Eout is bigger
      
      > but can we avoid havin to estimate T's labels? 
  

# Conflict in reliability matrix is too HIGH
