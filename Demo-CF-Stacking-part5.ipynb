Recall from **Demo Part 1 and 2** that the purpose of probaiblity filter is to help us select the entries that enter the optimization objective (e.g. approximating ratings/probability scores or approximating labels) or get left out of the optimization objective. Reliable entries should enter the optimization objectve while unreliable entries are typically left out (unless your loss function somehow can take into account of these entries, see C-square loss for an example)\n","\n","- Once we get `Th` (the re-estimated `T`), we will then combine their ratings to formulate our final class label predictions as usual (e.g., mean, majority vote, stacking)"],"metadata":{"id":"OygGrzU5pRRc"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"cellView":"form","id":"U3CTY_PLpLZc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649382565935,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1728,"user":{"displayName":"Barnett Chiu","userId":"11672137095150870396"}},"outputId":"311dd211-14b9-4f0c-d9eb-949be4fdc0c8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n","> Adding /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/machine_learning_examples/cf_ensemble to sys path ...\n","['', '/content', '/env/python', '/usr/lib/python37.zip', '/usr/lib/python3.7', '/usr/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages', '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/IPython/extensions', '/root/.ipython', '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/machine_learning_examples/cf_ensemble', '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/machine_learning_examples/cf_ensemble']\n"]}],"source":["#@title Import Basic Libraries\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from pandas import DataFrame, Series\n","import os, sys\n","\n","# Colab \n","try:\n","  import google.colab\n","  IN_COLAB = True\n","except:\n","  IN_COLAB = False\n","\n","# Plotting\n","import matplotlib.pylab as plt\n","# %matplotlib inline\n","\n","from matplotlib.pyplot import figure\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from IPython.display import display\n","\n","# Progress\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","\n","################################################################\n","# Configure system environment\n","# - Please modify input_dir according to your local enviornment\n","#\n","################################################################\n","\n","cur_dir = os.getcwd()\n","project_dir = 'machine_learning_examples/cf_ensemble'\n","if IN_COLAB: \n","    #
